NAME
    Tie::Diamond - Iterate the diamond operator via a Perl array

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::Diamond;
     tie my(@ary), "Tie::Diamond" or die;
     while (my ($idx, $item) = each @ary) {
         ...
     }

     # to autochomp lines ...
     tie my(@ary), "Tie::Diamond", {chomp=>1} or die;

DESCRIPTION
    This class lets you iterate the diamond operator via a Perl array.
    Currently the only useful thing you can do with the array is just
    iterate it using each(), as shown in Synopsis. To be more exact, the
    class currently only implements FETCH() and FETCHSIZE().

    The array backend does not slurp all lines into memory (or store past
    lines at all, actually), so it's safe to iterate over gigantic input.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

TIE() OPTIONS
    Options are passed as a hashref. Known keys:

    *   chomp => BOOL (default 0)

        If set to true, lines will be chomp()-ed.

    *   utf8 => BOOL (default 0)

        If set to true, will issue a 'use open qw(:std :utf8)' pragma so
        that input is read as UTF-8 data.

FAQ
  Why?
    So you can iterate using each(), basically, or to be compatible with a
    normal Perl.

    One of my modules, Data::Unixish, has functions that accept array. It
    can either an actual Perl array (to iterate over a in-memory structure),
    or a tied array (to iterate lines from STDIN/files). The functions do
    not need to care; they can just use each().

  Can I slurp?
     @other = @ary; # or print @ary

    Currently no. And anyway, if you want to slurp all lines, you might as
    well just do:

     @other = <>; # or print <>

    and skip this class altogether.
