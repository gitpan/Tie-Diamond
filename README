NAME
    Tie::Diamond - Iterate the diamond operator via a Perl array

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::Diamond;
     tie my(@ary), "Tie::Diamond" or die;
     while (my ($idx, $item) = each @ary) {
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you iterate the diamond operator via a Perl array.
    Currently the only useful thing you can do with the array is just
    iterate it using each(), as shown in Synopsis.

    The array backend does not slurp all lines into memory (or store past
    lines at all, actually), so it's safe to iterate over gigantic input.

FAQ
  Why?
    So you can treat the diamond operator as an array. One of my modules,
    Data::Unixish, uses this. A function can be passed a real array (to
    iterate over a Perl array), or a tied array (to iterate lines from STDIN
    or files mentioned in arguments); they don't have to change their
    iteration syntax.

  Can I do this?
     @other = @ary; # or print @ary

    Currently no. But since you are slurping all lines anyway, you might as
    well just do:

     @other = <>; # or print <>
