NAME
    Tie::Diamond - Iterate the diamond operator via a Perl array

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::Diamond;
     tie my(@ary), "Tie::Diamond" or die;
     while (my ($idx, $item) = each @ary) {
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    This module lets you iterate the diamond operator via a Perl array.

FAQ
  Why?
    So you can treat the diamond operator as an array. One of my modules,
    Data::Unixish, uses this. A function can be passed a real array (to
    iterate over a Perl array), or a tied array (to iterate lines from STDIN
    or files mentioned in arguments); they don't have to change their
    iteration syntax.

  Can I do this?
     @other = @ary; # or print @ary

    Currently no. But since you are slurping all lines anyway, you might as
    well just do:

     @other = <>; # or print <>
